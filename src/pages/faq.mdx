              The idea of Seiyanization is to establish a knowledge platform that simplifies the process of finding information about the Sei ecosystem that otherwise might be missed on other platforms. It is designed for both technical and non-technical people. One of the key features of Seiyanization is its search functionality, which ensures that users have access to the information they require in an efficient and user-friendly manner.
