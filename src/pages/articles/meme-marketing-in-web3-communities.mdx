## Sei's Meme Marketing: The Red Pepe

  <br/>  

### Background: Pepe the Frog and Its Popularity

Pepe the Frog, originally a comic character, gained immense popularity as an internet meme. Its versatility and widespread recognition made it an ideal candidate for creative reinterpretation in the context of meme marketing.

  <br/>

This creative twist not only captivated the community but also aligned perfectly with the brand's identity. By customizing Pepe the Frog, Sei's meme masters demonstrated a deep understanding of its audience's preferences.
