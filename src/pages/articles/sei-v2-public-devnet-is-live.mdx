It's been almost a week since the public devnet was launched, marking a significant milestone for the Sei ecosystem. Already, we've witnessed the birth of the first EVM devnet projects tailored for Sei, and I, for one, am itching to dive in and put them through their paces.

  

### Introduction

  

Sei v2 is the First Parallelized EVM chain. With the launch of a public devnet, Sei has removed barriers to entry, inviting enthusiasts to explore and test without hindrance.

  

**What is the EVM?**

  

The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is used to process transactions in blockchains such as Ethereum.

  

Every account on Sei has a unique public key, private key. In Sei V2, this public key translates into two different types of addresses:

In fact, with one private key, you gain access to two addresses – EVM (0x) and WASM (sei123) – with changes on either automatically reflected on the other.

If you deposit funds into your EVM address, you can access and use those same funds with your SEI address, and vice versa. They are linked together as one account, ensuring seamless integration between the EVM and SEI ecosystems.
