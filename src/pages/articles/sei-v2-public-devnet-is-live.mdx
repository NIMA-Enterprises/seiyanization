It's been almost a week since the public devnet was launched, marking a significant milestone for the Sei ecosystem. Already, we've witnessed the birth of the first EVM devnet projects tailored for Sei, and I, for one, am itching to dive in and put them through their paces.

  

### Introduction

  

Sei v2 is the First Parallelized EVM chain. With the launch of a public devnet, Sei has removed barriers to entry, inviting enthusiasts to explore and test without hindrance.

  

**What is the EVM?**

  

The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is used to process transactions in blockchains such as Ethereum.

  

On the public devnet, Sei will have an EVM address 0x, and this 0x address will be one and the same as the WASM (sei123) address. They are linked together as one account, ensuring seamless integration between the EVM and SEI ecosystems.

In fact, with one private key, you gain access to two addresses – EVM (0x) and WASM (sei123) – with changes on either automatically reflected on the other.
